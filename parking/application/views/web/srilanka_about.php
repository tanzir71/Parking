				       			A <strong>mysterious</strong> sunken land, a King with lion paws and the legend of Buddha’s footprint- the history of Sri Lanka is filled with secrets and controversy, making it the perfect place to start an adventure. Once you start to explore the varied history of this island you’ll discover two very different stories. Whilst many will remember the political discord and violence around Sri Lanka in the early 21st Century, few realise that the conflicts between the Sinhalese and Tamils has been ever-present through the origins of Sri Lankan culture.
				       		</p>
				       		<p>
								Most people will be familiar with the legend of the lost city of Atlantis and the tale of an entire land submerged beneath the rising sea and lost forever, but this familiar story of a land being reclaimed by the sea is also present in the Tamils history of Sri Lanka. Tamilan history tells of a thin strip of land that stretched 18 miles between the coasts of India and Sri Lanka, where the Pandiyan Kings (originally from the Tamil civilisation) ruled over the whole land.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you travel to the depths of the ocean in the area of water just south-west of Bengal Bay, you’ll find a distinct landform made up of limestone, pebbles, and other debris that joins India and Sri Lanka. Perhaps the legends of the Tamil culture aren’t so mythical after all?
							</p>
							<p>
								The notion of rising sea levels today is not uncommon, and most people are aware that if you travel back thousands of years ago the geography of our world would be completely different, so it’s not unreasonable to think many lost lands exist. Interestingly, The National Institute of Oceanography in India believe that the surrounding sea level could have risen by around 60m in the last 10,000 years which could, in theory, have submerged the entire 18 mile stretch of land.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, in the early 21st century NASA released pictures of this stretch of sea between Sri Lanka and India, and it was identified as not being a sunken land, but instead an ancient bridge that had collapsed. Whilst the origin of this bridge (and the identity of those who built it) is of great interest to archaeologists, religious historians are equally as curious as well. This is because Hindu beliefs tell the story of Rama, who built a bridge across the water in order to rescue his beloved wife, whilst in Islamic history the bridge is referred to as ‘Adam’s bridge’ and is believed to be the same bridge that Adam crossed when he was exiled from the Garden of Eden. Whilst the absolute truth of this underwater patch of limestone and pebbles may never be truly determined, it is a substantial part of Sri Lankan history.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another interesting legend relates to the fact that some Sinhalese people believe that they are the direct descendants of the first recorded King of Sri Lanka whose name was Vijaya. Vijaya is said to be the son of an ancient King who had lion-paws for hands and that even his grandfather himself was a lion! This ferocity was seen in the nature of Vijaya’s rule when he was exiled for his consistent wrongdoings and violence, so once he was banished he travelled around until finally starting a new kingdom in Sri Lanka. It’s believed that Vijaya arrived in Sri Lanka the day that Buddha passed away, which left Lord Vishnu to oversee and protect Vijaya and the people of Sri Lanka long into the future. Whilst today we know the island off the coast of southern India as Sri Lanka, up until 1972 it was known as Ceylon. As early as 1505, strong European powers took an interest in this region due to its proximity with India and the potential value in terms of trade and land ownership. At first it was the Portuguese settlers that occupied the kingdom of Kotte who began to colonise most of the isle; however tensions were high between the Portuguese and Sinhalese people due to religious conflicts.

							</p>
							<p>
								In 1640 the Dutch-Portuguese War led to the coalition of the Dutch army and Sri Lankan people to eliminate Portuguese rule from Ceylon. Once Portuguese forces left the area, the remaining leaders of the Netherlands and the Sinhala King began to clash over who would maintain control of the region. Rajasinghe II had played a dangerous game; he utilised the Dutch army to win the battle with the Portuguese and gain freedom for the Sinhalese, whilst simultaneously creating covert links with the French leaders to try and control the actions of the new Dutch presence in their community.
							</p>
							<p>
								By 1790 the Dutch had secured their position of dominance across the majority of Ceylon, but just 5 years later the British invaded to add Ceylon to its ever-expanding list of colonies around Asia.  As part of the Kew Letters of 1795, the Captain-general of the Dutch Republic ordered his maritime bases and all colonial governors to surrender control to the British forces. This was so that they could secure a deal for the British to help protect the Dutch Republic from the French forces. By the time the Dutch realised the consequences of this deal and saw their empire rapidly depleting it was too late, the British never returned control of Ceylon and it remained part of their empire until independence was granted in 1948.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka took his seat in September 1947 and was the leader who saw the nation gain its independence from Great Britain; however, he unfortunately passed away shortly after in 1952. By 1953 the following Prime Minster led Sri Lanka into the United Nations and the Sinhalese community continued to dominate Sri Lanka politically (including changing the national language to Sinhalese).  In 2002, an official ceasefire was signed between the LTTE (Tamil militant group) and the Sri Lankan government under the leadership of the United National Front party. This strong movement towards a unified and peaceful Sri Lanka enabled the region to become a hospitable and thriving tourist destination in the modern world.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	Today we see a much more peaceful and safe region, where hundreds of thousands of tourists visit each year to enjoy the many wonders of Sri Lanka. If you travel across Sri Lanka you’ll be able to explore a total of 8 UNESCO World Heritage sites, alongside many other fascinating points.

				    			<srong>Sri Lanka</srong> is one of the few countries with a very vast and rich cultural diversity. The culture is itself very unique and thereby contributes to the Sri Lankan identity. Sri Lankan culture includes a lot of customs and rituals, which date to more than 2000 years which were handed down from generation to generation. The most prominent feature of the Sri Lankan is its colorfulfestivals, which is one of the main tourist attractions. Religion plays an important role in molding the Sri Lankan culture and traditions.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	Sri Lankan culture if often reflected by the use of art, architecture, sculptures, and even food. Some people would say that Sri Lanka has a more conventional culture which is obviously influenced by the prominent religions prevailing the country such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, etc. The Sri Lankan way of life is very simple and filled with humility and happiness,this is one of the reasons why the Sri Lankans have a very great sense in appreciating the simple things in life such as nature.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	One of the main features of the culture is its Indian and European influence. Since most of the time Sri Lankan kings married Indian princesses they incorporated Indian culture into ours but still preserving the unique Sri Lankan identity. The European influence was a result of invasion from the Dutch and Portuguese and finally the British. Hospitality is also one of the prominent characteristics of the culture, making Sri Lankans one of the friendly nations in the world.

								<strong>Sri Lanka</strong> is filled with romantic landscapes, governed by rising mountains, lush forests, ocean like tanks and gushing waterfalls, that it was considered the lost paradise by many a globe trotters, who fell upon the country. The golden beaches of the country had been praised for their picture postcard views since eternity. The dusk and dawn and many human activities connected to these times of the day creates a vibrant picture along the coasts of Sri Lanka.

					        	The central highlands of the island are filled with pictures of stirring mountains carpeted with lush green tea gardens, roaring waterfalls mingling with the clouds and landscapes shimmering in sunlight and disappearing under the rising mist. Travelling towards the top of the country to the North Central Valley of the Kings, mountains covered with lush tropical forests disappears

Giant statues of Lord Buddha rises above the forest line while ancient palaces stand abandoned to the forest, waiting for a master, who long departed from life. Travelling further north the landscape changes drastically, North of Sri Lanka is a world apart from the rest of country. Colorful Hindu temples replace the white pagodas while sari clad damsels roam the streets on bicycles.

				    		<h5>Pearl of the Indian Ocean &amp; Teardrop of India:</h5>
				    		<p>
								<strong>Sri Lanka</strong> has two names that it’s also known as. The first is ‘pearl of the Indian Ocean’, this is said to be named after its incredible beauty, varied biodiversity (the highest in Asia!), as well as one of its main exports being precious gemstones. The second, the ‘teardrop of India’, is a little more obvious, due to its perfect teardrop shape and being off the coast of India.
					        </p>
					        <h5>The Sri Lankan head “waggle”:</h5>
				    		<p>
								In Sri Lanka, it’s very common for people to “waggle” their heads from side to side (more of a pendulum swing than a shaking of the head), there’s quite a bit of variation on what this actually means. But generally, it means “yes” or an affirmative answer. However, it can also be interpreted as “Do you agree?”.
					        </p>
				    		<h5>Sri Lankan national sport:</h5>
				    		<p>
								You might be mistaken for thinking the national sport of Sri Lanka is cricket. Although it is by far the most popular sport in the country (after it’s introduction by the British in the 1800s, and having several successful teams, coming runners up in some of the largest competitions), the national sport

				    			of the country is, in fact, volleyball, which was introduced in 1916.
				    		</p>
					        <h5>Sri Lanka’s largest export:</h5>
					        <p>
								Tea is Sri Lanka’s largest export, accounting for 12% of its export by product (2014). It’s the fourth largest exporter of tea in the world, and in February 2017, marked its 150th anniversary of tea exportation. Ceylon Tea, being that Sri Lanka is most known for, is considered by the cleanest tea in the world by the ISO (with the least pesticide residue quantities).
					        </p>
				    		<h5>Adam’s Peak:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Adam’s Peak is the most sacred mountain in the country. Steeped in legend and religious theories, Adam’s Peak (or Sri Pada) has pilgrims from all over the world climb to its peak by candlelight to stand in the famous footprint left there. Buddhist’s believe that it is the footprint of Buddha when he visited Sri Lanka. Tamil Hindus believe it’s the footprint of Lord Shiva. Christians and Muslims in Sri Lanka believe that this was the footprint of, Adam as he was exiled from Eden (some believing that Sri Lanka was Eden itself).Adam’s Peak was also noted by Marco Polo in 1298 during his travels that it was a place of pilgrimage even then.
					        </p>


					        <h5>Hydropower:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Thanks to the countries waterfalls and rivers, the majority (over 50% in 2014) of the power for the country is generated by Hydropower.
					        </p>

					        <h5>Cinnamon’s origins:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Cinnamon is known and loved around the world, from cinnamon buns to curries and Indian food. Cinnamon is actually from Sri Lanka and was discovered by the Egyptians as early as 2000BC, who used it for many things, including as a spice, but also as perfuming in the embalming process. Most of the world’s cinnamon still comes from Sri Lanka (80-90%!),  so you can thank them for sharing this with the world!
					        </p>

					        <h5>Universities:</h5>
				    		<p>
								There are twenty universities in Sri Lanka, which, considering the population (around 20 million) and the size of the country is impressive!
					        </p>

					        <h5>Literacy:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Over 92% of people living in the country are literate which means that they boast the highest literacy rate in the whole of South Asia. <br>
								<strong>How do we help?</strong> <br>
								We support the Rainbow Centre, a haven for children in extreme poverty areas which helps them receive education, welfare and medical help.
					        </p>
					        <h5>Sri Lankan flag:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Sri Lanka’s national flag is one of the oldest flags in the world. A golden lion flag was said to have been brought with the first king of Sri Lanka (Vijaya) from India. The golden lion, remained part of the flag until 1815 when Sri Lanka became British Ceylon where the Union flag of British Ceylon replaced it. The golden lion holding its sword was re-introduced in 1948 after independence was achieved in the same year.The four Bo leaves in the corners replaced spearheads in 1972 and represent four values of the nation; loving-kindness, compassion, equanimity & happiness. Can’t argue with those for strong principles!
					        </p>
					        <h5>Shopping:</h5>
				    		<p>
								Traditionally, Sri Lankan tourists bring spices, tea, jewelry, gemstones, high quality knits and gorgeous china. Around the island a large number of small shops and stalls where you can buy only what you need. In the cities are beginning to open large stores, but all the same - to European variety of products - Sri Lanka is far away. The main location of shopping, of course, is Colombo. Here you can buy very good quality jerseys at low prices; because many well-known European brands have production was in Sri Lanka. Partial products of these companies are sold at much lower prices than in Europe.
